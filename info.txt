array in python
In Python, an array is a data structure that can store multiple values under a single variable name. While Python doesn't have built-in support for arrays, you can use lists or the array module for similar functionality. For more advanced operations, the NumPy library is a popular choice.

Here's a quick example using the array module:

python
import array

# Create an array of integers
numbers = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Access elements
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1

# Add an element
numbers.append(6)

# Remove an element
numbers.remove(3)

# Print the array
print(numbers)  # Output: array('i', [1, 2, 4, 5, 6])
If you're working with large datasets or need more functionality, NumPy arrays are faster and more versatile. Let me know if you'd like to explore that!

iterator and lamda function python
Iterators and lambda functions are powerful tools in Python for handling data and creating concise code.

Iterators
An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through all the elements of a collection (like a list or tuple) one at a time. You can create an iterator using the iter() function and retrieve elements using next().

Example:

python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
iterator = iter(my_list)

print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3
Lambda Functions
A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but only has one expression.

Example:

python
# Lambda function to add two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
Combining Iterators and Lambda Functions
You can use lambda functions with iterators for concise operations. For example, applying a lambda function to each element in an iterable using map():

python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)

print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]

regex in python with detail example
Regular expressions (RegEx) in Python are used for pattern matching and text manipulation. Python provides the re module to work with RegEx.

Basic Example
Here's a simple example to check if a string starts with "Hello" and ends with "World":

python
import re

text = "Hello, World!"
pattern = "^Hello.*World$"

# Search for the pattern
result = re.search(pattern, text)

if result:
    print("Pattern matched!")
else:
    print("No match.")
Common Functions
findall(): Returns all matches in a list.

python
import re
text = "The rain in Spain"
matches = re.findall("ai", text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['ai', 'ai']
search(): Returns a match object if the pattern is found.

python
import re
text = "The rain in Spain"
match = re.search("Spain", text)
print(match.start())  # Output: 12 (start index of match)
split(): Splits the string at each match.

python
import re
text = "The rain in Spain"
result = re.split("\s", text)
print(result)  # Output: ['The', 'rain', 'in', 'Spain']
sub(): Replaces matches with a string.

python
import re
text = "The rain in Spain"
result = re.sub("Spain", "India", text)
print(result)  # Output: "The rain in India"
Metacharacters
Metacharacters are special symbols in RegEx:

[]: Matches any character in the set.

^: Matches the start of the string.

$: Matches the end of the string.

.: Matches any character except newline.

*: Matches zero or more occurrences.

+: Matches one or more occurrences.

?: Matches zero or one occurrence.

{}: Specifies the exact number of occurrences.

For more detailed examples, you can explore resources like W3Schools or Programiz. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific aspect!

Can you show a more complex example of RegEx?
Certainly! Here's a more complex example of using regular expressions in Python to extract specific patterns from a text. Let's say we want to extract all email addresses from a given string:

python
import re

# Sample text
text = """
Hello, you can reach out to us at support@example.com or sales@example.org.
For personal inquiries, contact john.doe123@example.net or jane_doe@example.co.uk.
"""

# Regular expression pattern for email addresses
email_pattern = r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'

# Find all email addresses
emails = re.findall(email_pattern, text)

# Print the extracted email addresses
print("Extracted Emails:")
for email in emails:
    print(email)
Explanation of the Pattern
[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+: Matches the username part of the email, which can include letters, digits, dots, underscores, and special characters like %, +, and -.

@: Matches the @ symbol.

[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+: Matches the domain name, which can include letters, digits, dots, and hyphens.

\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}: Matches the top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org, .net), which must start with a dot and have at least two letters.

Output
When you run the code, it will extract and print all email addresses from the text:

Extracted Emails:
support@example.com
sales@example.org
john.doe123@example.net
jane_doe@example.co.uk
This example demonstrates how you can use regular expressions to handle more complex tasks like pattern extraction. Let me know if you'd like to explore even more intricate use cases!

how to pull out mobile number using regex
To extract mobile numbers using regular expressions in Python, you can use the re module. Here's an example:

python
import re

# Sample text containing mobile numbers
text = """
Contact us at +91-9876543210 or 9876543210.
You can also reach us at (123) 456-7890 or 123.456.7890.
"""

# Regular expression pattern for mobile numbers
mobile_pattern = r'\+?\d{1,3}?[-.\s]?\(?\d{1,4}?\)?[-.\s]?\d{1,4}[-.\s]?\d{1,4}[-.\s]?\d{1,9}'

# Find all mobile numbers
mobile_numbers = re.findall(mobile_pattern, text)

# Print the extracted mobile numbers
print("Extracted Mobile Numbers:")
for number in mobile_numbers:
    print(number)
Explanation of the Pattern
\+?: Matches an optional + for international codes.

\d{1,3}?: Matches 1 to 3 digits (country code).

[-.\s]?: Matches an optional separator (dash, dot, or space).

\(?\d{1,4}?\)?: Matches an optional area code enclosed in parentheses.

\d{1,4}: Matches 1 to 4 digits (local number parts).

[-.\s]?: Matches optional separators between number parts.

\d{1,9}: Matches the remaining digits of the number.

Output
When you run the code, it will extract and print all mobile numbers from the text:

Extracted Mobile Numbers:
+91-9876543210
9876543210
(123) 456-7890
123.456.7890
This pattern is flexible and can handle various formats of mobile numbers. Let me know if you'd like to refine it further for specific use cases!
